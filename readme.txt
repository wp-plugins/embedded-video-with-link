== Description ==

Please rate this plugin!

The plugin is made for easily embedding videos into a blog post. The videos can be integrated from external portals (like YouTube, Google Video and many many others) or they can be uploaded to the web server or a remote server and integrated as well. Additionally a corresponding link to the video on the particular video portal page or a download link to the local file can be generated automatically, if demanded. The linktext is also configurable individually.
Furthermore a fixed prefix for the linktext can be determined. 
The videos can be integrated easily by using the built-in WYSIWYG editor. The plugin generates XHTML-valid code an works with WP 2.0.x and 2.1.x

== Installation ==

Copy the subfolder "embedded-video" with all included files into the "wp-content/plugins" folder of WordPress. Then go to the menu "Administration" > "Plugins" and activate it. 
If you want the plugin to play own Flash videos (FLV/SWF files), you need to add [Jeroen Wijerings Flash-Video-Player](http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Video_Player). Download the zip-file, extract it and copy the containing folder ‘flash_flv_player’ to the plugin folder ‘embedded-video’.

Note: If you want to use the Flash Video Player commercially, a license fee has to be paid!

== Configuration ==

The configuration options are simple and do not need explanation. See the administration panel of the plugin in your WP admin frontend.
